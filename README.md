# Unity Exercises

A collection of my personal experimental Unity projects. This repository is public and contains various Unity projects that I am working on as I explore new concepts and ideas.

## Projects
1. [Two-Player Mode Character Selection System](https://github.com/rendercodeninja/unity-exercises/tree/main/character-selector)

    This is a character selection screen designed for a 2-Player Mode combat game, inspired by games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. This project demonstrates how to create a UI for selecting characters with smooth transitions, input handling and user interactions.

More experimental projects will be added soon.


## How to Use
Clone or download the repository.
Each project is contained within its own subfolder. Navigate to the desired project and open it with Unity.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the projects! üòäüçª
